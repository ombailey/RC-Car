# <span class="header"> Mission </span> : Operation Ghost Runner 

![Rover](../Images/Car%20Assembly%201.JPG)

You are a rogue engineer in a post-corporate dystopia where all transportation is controlled by mega-corps. Citizens aren’t allowed to build or operate their own machines—only rent overpriced, GPS-tracked drones from the state.

The problem: A rebel ally needs a smuggled microchip delivered across the border zone—quietly, swiftly, and without being detected by the Surveillance Grid.

The catch? You can’t go in person. You’ll need to build a stealthy, off-grid RC car, capable of navigating rough terrain, dodging drones, and carrying a payload the size of a Tic Tac box.

## Basic Tasks

* ~~Create wheels and rims that fit the motor~~
* ~~Create car chassis that fits the motors and has necessary modifications to it~~
* ~~Fit all elements onto the chassis~~
* ~~Connect all wheels to power~~
* ~~Connect arduino to wheels~~
* ~~Learn how to use h-bridge for the motors~~

## Upgrade Tasks

* Get car to record footage and take pictures
    * Arduino camera module
    * Create camera case 
    * Connect to arduino
    * Learn how to record and take pictures using the camera module
* Change treads on wheels to move on smooth surcaces (wooden floor)
* Add LED lights that turn on when dark automatically
